+Install
Copy the contents in the system folder to your Killing Floor system folder.

+Usage
In the key configuration menu, there is a menu titled "HUD Stopwatch Controls".  Bind those commands to toggle and 
start/stop the stopwatch.  There is a bug with the controls menu that displays custom aliases twice.  The one that lists 
your binded keys is the one to modify.
